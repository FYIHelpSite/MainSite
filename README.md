## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Outline of the Site**

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see here:

    â”œâ”€â”€ Zendesk_Documentation.pdf
    â””â”€â”€ README.txt
    
- The documentation contains some of the knowledge needed to edit portion of the sites but more needs to be done to have a complete understanding of where and how to edit the code. The documentation is not complete but I have uploaded a draft with most of the elements that we have worked with. Will update with more edits as required. 

- Will add more related knowledge such as pitfalls and how to avoid them, what parts of the code to edit in case we want to change something, etc. 
 
1.  **`article_page`**: The file where article pages are stored.

2.  **`category_page`**: This file edits the categories within the site as SASS elements. 

3.  **`community_post_list_page`**: This file contains information of the community posts. 

4.  **`error_page`**: This file contains the 404 page of what is shown when the website is down. 

5.  **`footer`**: This file contains the footer and has the SVG of the banner logo. 

6.  **`styles.css`**: This file contains the CSS of the site and classes must be created to refrence between the HTML, using the (.) reference.

7.  **`script.js`**: This file contains the javascript of the site and is used to edit more advanced features of the site such as event handling, clicks, dropdowns, navagation, etc. Nothing should really be edited here unless we are certain it wont break the site as this creates the actual functionality. 


5.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for a tool called [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), which is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.


9.  **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.

10. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. (You wonâ€™t change this file directly).


12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

13. **`yarn.lock`**: [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is a package manager alternative to npm. You can use either yarn or npm, though all of the Gatsby docs reference npm. This file serves essentially the same purpose as `package-lock.json`, just for a different package management system.
