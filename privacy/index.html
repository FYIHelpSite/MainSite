        </h1>
        <p class="u-text u-text-2"> This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains how FYI.FYI (“FYI.FYI” or “we” ) collects, uses, and shares your information when you use our various services (“Services”). Using and accessing any of our Services is subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy, and by doing so you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the accompanying Terms of Service. <br>
          <br>FYI.FYI is a messaging and collaboration platform that gives you the power to share your ideas and communicate with the world. We give you tools to communicate with others one-on-one (“messaging”), in collaborative circles (“groups”), and to the public at large (“posting”). We also give you tools to store and share access to files you create. That’s a lot of information you’re trusting us with – here’s how we handle and use it. <br>
          <br>We only store the data that FYI.FYI needs to function as a secure and feature-rich messaging and collaboration tool, and keeping your data private and secure is of utmost importance to us. Most of the data collection and uses described in this Privacy Policy are necessary in order for us to be able to provide you the Services.  We do collect and use data in some ways not strictly necessary for us to provide the Services, but they are related to the Services and our basis for the collection and processing are legitimate interests we have, such as to analyze and improve the Services. <br>
          <br>
        </p>
        <h2 class="u-text u-text-3"> INFORMATION WE COLLECT&nbsp;<br>
        </h2>
        <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-4"> As we provide you the Services, we collect information in these four general categories, which we further describe below. <br>

All of this information that may identify, relate to, describe, reference, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer, household, or device is called “Personal Information.” <br>
          <br>

User content information is subject to the controls you place upon it, for example one-to-one messages are generally available to the intended recipient, but User Content, even when access is limited to you only, is accessible and may be reviewed by us for the purpose of enforcing our community standards, to comply with legal requirements, or for the purpose of improving our Services. <br>
          <br>For more information, please see our Terms of Service. For public posts, post contents and replies are public and are publicly displayed. For group posts, all others with access to the group may read, display, and reply to any information you make available to the group. It is possible for a group member to download or otherwise copy information you share and then further share it in other forums. <br>
          <br>We also collect information you choose to upload, sync, or import from a device (such as a contacts list or location), which we use for things like helping you and others find people you may know. <br>&nbsp;<br>

The data protection and other laws of the United States might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. <br>
          <br>By using our Services, you acknowledge and agree that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Privacy Policy. <br>

          <br>
          <br>If you are an EU citizen or UK citizen, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation or the UK-GDPR  (collectively, the “GDPR”) with respect to your Personal Data, as outlined below. For this section, we use the terms “Personal Data” and “processing” as they are defined in the GDPR, but “Personal Data” means information that can be used to individually identify a person, and “processing” covers actions that can be performed in connection with data such as collection, use, storage and disclosure. We are the controller of your Personal Data processed in connection with the Services. <br>
          <br>The legal bases for which we collect and use Personal Data above depends on what the information is and why we collected it. The four bases upon which we rely include: <br>
          <br>Contract. This means we need the information to perform our contracted Services with you. When we process data by contractual necessity, the Services that require that data will not work if you fail or refuse to provide such Personal Data. <br>
          <br>Legal Obligation. We use your personal information to comply with a law enforcement preservation request, subpoena, or other legal process or to protect the rights of other users. <br>
          <br>Legitimate Interests. This means we have a legitimate interest that does not outweigh your privacy rights. When we collect and process information based on our legitimate interests, we consider how we can accomplish what we need to in a way that is the least obtrusive on your privacy. <br>
          <br>Consent. If we have no other legal basis for collecting or using your information, we will ask you for consent for a specific purpose. If we do, you have the right to withdraw consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not apply to any processing conducted in reliance on lawful processing bases other than consent. <br>
          <br>In addition to other rights detailed in the policy (such as requesting deletion, correction or updating of your personal information), EU and UK citizens have certain rights regarding your personal information, including: <br>
          <br>Right to Object or Restrict Processing.  You have the right to object to or restrict our use of your personal information for direct marketing purposes or under certain circumstances when the legal bases for using your information is based upon our legitimate interest. If you wish to object to our use of your information, you can send us a request to info@fyi.fyi. <br>Right to Access and Portability. You also have the right to access the Personal Data we have collected about you, and receive information you have provided to us in a portable format.  You can send us a request to access your information by sending an email to info@fyi.fyi. <br>
          <br>Right to Erasure.  You have the right to have your personal data erased and no longer processed. Upon receiving the request, we will make a reasonable effort to delete your personal information from the Service and from our internal network within a reasonable period of time as long as we are not obligated to preserve your information due to things like law enforcement preservation requests, subpoenas, investigations, litigation, or otherwise meet any of our other legal obligations. We may also retain depersonalized information after deletion. You can send us a request to delete your account or access your information by sending an email to info@fyi.fyi. <br>
          <br>Withdrawal of Consent. If we are processing your Personal Data based on your consent (as indicated at the time of collection of such data), you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.  You can exercise your right to withdraw consent by sending an email to info@fyi.fyi. <br>
          <br>File a Complaint. You have the right to complain to the data protection authority located in your Member State.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
